## UX

I created an application called ONLINE COOKBOOK that allows user to store and easily access recipes.
The app is a recipe Festival that will store all your Festive and occasional recipes in one place! It allow the user
to read recipe, create new recipe, edit and delete them (CRUD).

* see card of all recipes
* see a list of all recipes
* search for recipes by choosen category
* register to the application with username and password
* login to the application with username and password
* Msnsge cstegoris by
* create new categories

## TESTING

This website had been tested on different devices such as: Desktop, Tablet, Mobile. I used Chrome DevTools to make sure it works on: Samsung Galaxy S5, iPhone 5/6/7/8, iPad, PC Desktop;


## TROUBLESHOOTING

**Registration and Login system** - that was the biggest challenge but with lots of searching in google  websites I eventually  was able to create it

##### To be fixed

Add alert messages to registration and login system: 

* when user register to the app successfully - confirmation message should pop up
* when user login and try to use the same username which already exist - warning message should pop up
